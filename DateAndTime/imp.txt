1:The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision.

2:   1 day = 24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds in all cases.

3:In Java, the Date class is part of the java.util package and is used to represent date and time. 


5: Get the time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch)

6: Calendar provides a class method, getInstance, for getting a generally useful object of this type. Calendar's getInstance method returns a Calendar object whose calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:

     Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();

A Calendar object can produce all the calendar field values needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).     



4. Pattern Symbols
Here are some commonly used pattern symbols in SimpleDateFormat:

Symbol	Description	       Example

h	Hour in am/pm (1-12, hh)	  03
m	Minute in hour (mm)	20
s	Second in minute (ss)	   30
a	AM/PM marker	             PM

//Class GregorianCalendar
GregorianCalendar is a concrete subclass of Calendar and provides the standard calendar system used by most of the world.

Default Fields Values
The clear method sets calendar field(s) undefined. GregorianCalendar uses the following default value for each calendar field if its value is undefined.

Field                       	Default Value
YEAR                           	1970
ERA	                              AD
MONTH                       	JANUARY
DAY_OF_MONTH                       	1
DAY_OF_WEEK                       	the first day of week
AM_PM	                                             AM
HOUR, HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE, SECOND, MILLISECOND	       0
Default values are not applicable for the fields not listed above.
